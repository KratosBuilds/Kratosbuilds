## Hi there 👋🏾
# 👋 Hi, I'm KratosBuilds!

As a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in web development and technical communication, I bring a blend of hands-on coding experience and analytical depth that makes me a strong candidate for internships.

## 🌐 Front-End & Web Development Experience

My web development journey began with building responsive interfaces using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, later expanding into frameworks like **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. I’ve developed and deployed several personal and academic projects, including:

- **Dynamic Portfolio Site:** Showcasing my projects and resume, built with React and hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Blog Platform Prototype:** Using Firebase for backend and authentication, with an emphasis on user experience and accessibility.
- **Hackathon Projects:** Collaborative coding environments where I contributed to UI design and API integration.

These experiences have honed my ability to write clean, maintainable code and collaborate effectively in agile environments.

## 🧠 Interviewing & Communication Skills

I’ve participated in mock technical interviews and peer-led coding challenges, sharpening my problem-solving and articulation skills. I’m comfortable explaining complex concepts—like asynchronous JavaScript or RESTful API design—to both technical and non-technical audiences. My academic focus on ethical inquiry and source evaluation strengthens my ability to ask thoughtful questions and assess project requirements critically.

## ✍️ Technical Writing & Publications

I regularly write journal entries and technical reflections on topics like AI ethics, bias mitigation, and cybersecurity. My writing emphasizes clarity, structure, and audience awareness, often integrating APA-style citations and multi-perspective analysis. Here are a few samples:

- **Understanding Bias in AI Systems** – A reflective piece on algorithmic fairness and transparency.
- **Building Trust Through Ethical Web Design** – A blog post exploring UX principles and ethical considerations.
- **Source Credibility in Tech Journalism** – A guide for evaluating media sources in tech reporting.
